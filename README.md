A simple bot for discord made with [discordrb](https://github.com/meew0/discordrb). The bot is under active development, I'm adding new features and fixing issues everyday. If you don't want to tinker around with code or host the bot on your own, you can invite it to your server by pressing the invite badge above. However, if you do, there are some *poorly written* instructions down [below](https://github.com/PoVa/sapphire_bot#installation).

### Features

* Youtube music bot! Join a voice channel, use the `join` command and add songs with `add <song name>` command.

* Automatic link shortening with https://goo.gl/. Whenever a link within a message is detected, the message gets replaced and all its links shortened. Example:

  `PoVa: look at his dank maymay m8: http://img.ifcdn.com/images/a52e08ff36a62190f8259a6b5e9aa2f9f9a86bb841bc6b01aa6cbacc7bbe846f_1.jpg`

  (Original message deleted)

  `Sapphire: PoVa: look at his dank maymay m8: http://goo.gl/U7GO0D`

  This feature is disabled by default, but you can enable it with the following command: `toggle shortening`. You can find ignored urls [here](https://github.com/PoVa/sapphire_bot/blob/master/data/ignored_urls.yml).

* Owner of the bot can send mass message to all servers by sending the bot a private message.

### Installing and running
1. Make sure you have `git` and `bundler` gem installed, then

   `$ git clone https://github.com/PoVa/sapphire_bot.git`

3. (optional) Install voice [dependencies](https://github.com/meew0/discordrb#voice-dependencies). This is how I do it on my linux machine:

  `sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev`

  `sudo apt-get install libopus-dev`

  `sudo apt-get install libav-tools`

4. Run `bundle install`

  `$ bundle install --without development`

5. (Windows only) Uncomment and modify this line in `run.rb` file:

  `#::RBNACL_LIBSODIUM_GEM_LIB_PATH = "PATH TO LIBSODIUM"`

6. Run the bot.

  * Linux:

      `$ ./run.sh`

  * Windows:

      Just double click `run.bat` icon, you peasant.

  * Literally anywhere:

      `$ ruby run.rb`


After you've done with configuration, invite url should pop up, use it to make the bot join your server.

### Updating

  `$ git pull`

  `$ bundle install`

### Debugging

  Run the bot with `-debug` command line option:

  `$ ./run -debug`
